Checking for long term side effects.\n\nPlacebos counter the physcological effect of having a drug/medical attention\n\nBlindness:\n\n- Single : Patient or practioner is unaware of which treatment\n- Double : Both unaware\n\n## Bradford-Hill\n\nIf all met does not mean causality, just sensible tests.\n\n- Temporality - Effect follows cause\n- Consistency - Does it happen in multiple groups (gender, countries, etc)\n- Coherence - Do controlled and observational studies agree\n- Strength of Association - Greater effect observed if given treatment\n- Biological Gradient - More agent, more effect\n- Specificity - does agent specifically affect what it is applied to Eg. cream on hand, fixes hand\n- Plausibility - Can it be explained mechanistically\n- Freedom from bias/confounders\n- Analgous results elsewhere - similir agents have similar results\n\n## Ethics\n\n### Medical\n\nTrial design is key\n\n- Only trial if you genuinely don't know whether one is better\n- Poorly planned/exexuted (eg under powered) is very unethical\n- Patients have informed consent\n- Placebos are ethical. The ethics of the population vs individual\n- Ethics commitee buys in\n\n### Publication\n\nAlot of money at stake\n\n- Avoid publication bias, only publishing good results\n- Journal contributors must: declare full responsibilty held over trial, had access to data, made decision to publish.\n\n# Chapter 2 - Trial Design\n\n## Parrallel\n\nk treatments, split into k groups. May aim for equal sized groups, though not mandatory.\n\nRequires large numbers to be sure of treatemtn effects. Robust to withdrawls\n\n## In Series\n\nAll patients, recieve all k treatments in same order. Allowing for in patient comparison.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Patient can express preferences\n- Possiblity for simultaneous treatment\n\nIssues:\n- Patients may naturally imporve over time, making later treatments look better. Progressive disease act oppositely.\n- Carry over effects may exist, short term effects only\n- Withdrawls can be problematic\n- Some orders are impossible\n\n## Cross Over\n\nImproves upon in series to account for treatment, period, carryover.\n\nAll aptients get same treatements, but groups recieve in different order.\n\nIn the event of dropouts period one could be used as a parrallel study, though very low powered.\n\nWashout may be placed between treatments (no treatment window) to minimise carryover risk.\n\n## Factorial Design\n\nInvestigate effect of two or more treatments (factors), by giving combinations. \n\nEg 2x2. Each parient takes two drugs, where each drug has a placebo counterpart. Could take any combination of both drugs, one drug/one placebo, all placebo.\n\nMay be more efficent design. May also be prone to interactions, though this is of interest.\n\nMean response plots are useful for visualising effects:\n\n- Two parrallel lines, no interaction\n- One gradient increases more, quantitative interaction\n- opposite gradianets, qualitative interation\n\nTODO : PRACTICE No interaction, qualitative, quantitative\n\n## Sequential Design\n\nSimple form, aptients enter as pairs, and randomly allocated A or B.\n\nAssess which is better and move onto next pair. Cumulatively aggregate the prefference.\n\nYou will either cross a diverging boundary and stop early or reach end point and declare no difference.\n\nIt's an ethical approach, detecting large differences quickly.\n\nHowever:\n\n- Need quick response times (before next pair)\n- Dropouts cause issues\n- Requires constant attention\n- Boundary calculation is complex\n\n# Chapter 3 - Protocol\n\nProtocol contains:\n\n- Why do the trial\n- Patient selection/exclusion\n- Sample size calcs\n- Trial design\n- How response evaluated\n- Analysis methods\n\nProtocol deviations are to be expected, but must be recorded. There are two responses to deviation.\n\n- Per Protocol : Just exclude any partient that deviated. Problems are, power loss, affects randomisation, deviation may be a result of side effects.\n- Intention to Treat : Preffered, requires patients to be retained, though may yield curious answers. TODO - This is puzzling p21\n\nCan always report both!\n\n# Chapter 4 - Randomisation\n\n## Historic\n\nTODO p24\n\n## Simple Randomisation\n\nGenerate or look up sequence of numbers. Bin the numbers into equally sized groups.\n\nIf there is surplus, eg 3 groups, 10 Rand No. Then ignore the designated surplus number and move to next.\n\nEg.\n\n0 1 6 7 3 2 6 8 9 5 3 2 2\n\nA : 1-3\nB : 4-6\nC : 7-9\n0 : ignore and try again\n\nNegative :\n\n- In small trial balance can be poor\n\nPositive :\n\n- Completely unpredictable\n- In long run will create equal groups\n\n## Blocking\n\nBlocking is where we create clusters of treatment assignments, to ensure balanced groups.\n\nEg.\nAB, BA\n0-4 = AB\n5-9 = BA\n\nJust move along the random numbers in sequence, don't do every second, etc\n\nBlock size can be increased to make it harder to crack Eg\n\nAABB, ABBA, ABAB, BBAA, BABA, etc\n\nBlocking may be crackable with small block sizes and thus may risk double blindness.\n\nBlocking can also be used for imbalance setting.\n\nBlock size should be as large as possible to minimise risk of cracking. But not so large that the last block would be highly imbalanced if split as it reached the end.\n\n## Stratified Randomisation\n\nTODO : Watch the video on this and verify below notes (I'm 99% sure they are good)\n\nTreatment (control included) groups should be as equal as possible in terms of patient characterirstics (Age, gender, etc). Imblances could confound treatments with characteristics. Solve with stratified randomisation.\n\nSay we have M/F, Over, under 50\n\nCat.   | Schema\n-------|----------------\nM, <50 | A B B A B B A A\nF, <50 | B A B A B A A B\nM, >50 | A B A B B A A B\nF, >50 | A B A B A B B A\n\nInstead of now applying patient count numbers, we move through the list of patients (which should itself be random), sequentially crossing off as we go.\n\n## Minimisation/Adaptive randomisation\n\nWhere there are lots of factors strification can become impractical.\n\nMinimisation is dynamic assignment of patients to different treatments to achieve.\n\nSteps:\n\n1) Create a table where first column is characteristics, second col is factor, all other columns are treatment tallys for the characteristics\n2) Sum down the columns and look for lowest score\n3) Add the patient to that group and update the tally\n4) Repeat\n5) If score are equal, randomise.\n\nThis is not truely random and could lead to a level of prediction if the assignent history is known. To add randomisation you might add a probability of assignment to the smaller so if it is smaller there is some p between 0.5 and 1 whether it is assigned \n\n# Chapter 5 - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\"A null hypothesis which will be adopted unless there is significant evidence from the data that the alternate hypothesis is more viable.\"\n\nThe test statistic has a sampling distribution, under the assumption $H_0$ is true.\n\nCalculate the proability that the test statistics is as or more extreme than that observed. This is done with the sampling distribution.\n\nThe course has the following convention for the significance probability (p-value)\n\np-value| statement\n-----|-----\np>0.1|No evidence against $H_0$\n0.05<p<0.01 |Weak evidence against $H_0$\n0.05<p<0.01 | Some evidence against\n0.05<p<0.01 | Strong evidence against\np<0.001 | Very strong evidence against\n\nIn this course a conclusion should be as follows:\n\n- Identify evidence strength verbally and quote p-value\n- State the null hypothesis you are rejecting, without using the words Null Hypothesis / $H_0$. Use a description.\n- Do not convert $H_0$ inadvertently to one-sided test\n- State the direction of change and a mean (point value)\n- Provide confidence intervals if significant\n\n\nCare should be taken with p-value:\n- Even with substantial evidence, alternative may not actually be true\n- An effect can be statistically significant, but be too small to matter IRL\n- A large p-value does not mean alterbative is wrong. Could have two little data, poor design or by chance\n\nTests have assumptions!\n\n## Two-Sample T-Test\n\nOne sample required if:\n\n- Comparing matched groups (difference from 0)\n- Comparing to a baseline, fixed value\n\n1) Identify continuous\n\n2) Declare independence and that population variance not known\n3) Declare a two sample t-test\n4) Identify subscripts with \"Let X be \"\n5) Write that \n$H_0 : \\mu_X = \\mu_Y$ and \n$H_A : \\mu_X \\neq \\mu_Y$\n6) Calculate N, $\\bar{X}$ and  $S^2_X$\n7) Calculate $\\nu = min(N_X, N_Y)$\n8) Calulate test statistic $T = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_X^2}{N_X} + \\frac{S_Y^2}{N_Y}}}$\n\n9) $T \\sim t_{\\nu}$\n\n10) Look up p value in tables (either neg or pos), DOUBLE IT, it's two sided $P( |t_{\\nu}| > T)$\n\n11) Calulate the mean delta and find 95% (0.025-0.975) CI \n\nAs N gets big, t tends to normal, therefore 1.96 (approx. 2) becomes CI multiplier\n\nAssume normally distributed and independent samples\n\n## Chi-Square Test\n\nUses:\n\n- Comparing two dicscrete groups\n- Deciding whether two factors are independent\n- Test a theory, eg. something can be modelled as a set ratio\n\n1) Identify count based and that $\\chi_2$ appropriate\n2) Calculate all row and column totals. Calculate overall total\n3) Calulate each $e_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{row total}\\times \\text{col total}}{\\text{Overall Total}}$\n4) Calulate $\\frac{(o_{ij}-e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}$\n4) Sum them to get the test stat $X^2$\n5) State that $X^2 \\sim \\chi^2_{\\nu}$\n6) $\\nu = (\\text{n row - 1})\\times (\\text{n col - 1})$ \n7) This is a one sided test due to squaring!\n8) Convert the coloumns from counts to percents of column total for reporting\n\nTODO: Not worked beyond 5.4\n\n## Further Notes\n\n### Multiple Testing\n\nJust comparing two groups relies heavily on well balanced randomisation.\n\nUsing multiple regression we can include and therefore account for covariates (prognostic factors), this is called an ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)\n\n### One vs Two sided tests\n\nAlways, unless very strong **prior** knowledge, use a two sided test. One sided are more powerful. \n\nEg. If you think something will decrease and go one sided, but it actually increased you would miss it, potentailly missing a harmful effect.\n\n### Pooled or seperate variance\n\nAlways seperate on the course:\n\n- If you use seperate and they are the same you will still get an unbiased estimateof common variance\n- This case would result in more DoF from welch approx, however this is slightly more conservative anyway\n- However using pooled when not can get you very different DoF, whether pessimistic/optimistic is not possible to know without calcs\n\nWe use pooled on power tests otherwise it become impractical to assess.\n\n### Testing for equality of variance\n\nDon't:\n\n- Low powered tests\n- Non-sig does not mean equal, only weak evidence\n- If doing one test followed by another you are multiple testing ? TODO - p44 confusing answer I think hinting at multiple testing\n\n\nTODO 5.6\n\n\n# Chapter 6 - Power\n\nEssential ethically:\n\n- Too few, low power, study could be waste\n- Too mnay, excessive number of people exposed\n\nSix steps:\n\n1) Declare trial type (usually parralel)\n2) Describe outcome $\\mu$ or $\\theta$ in most of what we do\n3) Describe end test eg. two sample t-test\n4) Declare baseline $\\mu$ or $\\theta$\n5) Declare CRD (Clinical Relevant Difference) Eg. $\\mu_X - \\mu_Y$\n6) Set Power , $1- \\beta$\n7) Calculate n, **remember it is per group!**\n\nUseful notes:\n\n- $\\Phi^{-1}(\\beta)$ and $\\Phi^{-1}(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$ will be negative for sensible values\n- In one sided testing $\\Phi^{-1}(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$ becomes $\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$\n- In the binomial case $(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)^2$ drives the equation. Therefore to detect a half smaller change requires 4 times the population.\n\nSome lessons from assignment:\n\n- Always $\\Phi$ not $\\phi$ when doing inv norm cdf\n- Explain why you round up\n- Don't automatically account for dropouts, only if asked\n\n\n# Chapter 7 - Multiplicity\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- You can break most rules, IF, you declare in protocol\n-Bonferonni is very poor when results corrrelated.\n\n- Multiple Endpoints\n- Subgroup Analysis\n- Interim Analysis\n- Multiple Regression\n- Repeated Measures\n\nIncreases risk of false positives. Medical trials are very expensive and ethically can only look at so many people, so tempting to fish.\n\nIn one test the p-value controls false positve risk. However in multiple tests, the problem becomes at least one.\n\nA 95% chance of not making an error, then two tests not making an error is $0.95^2 = 0.9025$, so about 1 in 10 and so on. For 10 this becomes 40%. The general formula is, for k tests:\n\n$1-(1-\\alpha)^k$\n\nBonferonni correction is extremely conservative correctiuon based on rearranging it. The correction is:\n\n$\\frac{\\alpha}{k}$\n\n### Multiple End Points\n\nApply a therapy and assess multiple outcomes. Eg Give new heart meds, measure pulse, bp standing, bp sitting, etc\n\n- Could apply bonferooni, but alot might be correlated. So the could get lots of low p-values but all rejected\n- In the protocal, declare very limited responses of interest and focus test on these. Caputure and assess others though to verify nothing worrying\n- Multivariate analysis can handle much of the issues of correlation and multiplicity, however very hard to use\n\n### Sub Group Analysis\n\nSub groups are patient characteristics. Eg. Age brackets, gender, etc.\n\nAgain, only acceptable to favour one if declared in the protocol.\n\nAgain, you should still study the sub-groups and may wish to use it to inform further research.\n\nCould use:\n\n- Bonferroni adjustment, again conservative, though seperate subgroups tend to be less correlated than end points\n- Use ANOVA across groups, but this only tells you if one is different in the mean\n- If sig detected follow up with additional tests Eg. Dunnets, Tukey Multiple Range\n\nAs well as splitting, we must be very careful doing post hoc combinations. PROTOCOL!\n\n### Interim Analysis\n\nAnalysing as data streams in from trials.\n\nMay want to do it as:\n\n- Check protocol for adherence\n- Catch side effects early\n- Provide feedback, stakeholder engaement\n- Catch large effects early, ethical. You would want an extremely low p-value to justify.\n\nWhen adding more data and repeating the tests we do not use bonferroni as not independent, other more complicated methods are used.\n\nDECLARE INTERIM CHECK IN PROTOCOL\n\n### Multiple Regression\n\nIn multiple regression we typically don't worry about multiplicity, we have purposely chosen to include them.\n\nProblematic when we either just chuck everything in to see what happens. Especially with interactions and high order interactions, the number of variables can balloon.\n\nSolution:\n\n- Use domain knowledge to inform model, create interactions a priori\n- Use bonferonni\n\n### Repeated Measures\n\nMeasuring an outcome, on the same person, over time. Eg blood concentration at 1,4,8,16 hours.\n\nYou can solve using:\n\n- Summary stats designed for repeat measures Eg. Area Under Curve (AUC)\n- Bonferroni (highly correlated though).\n- Multivariate analysis that models correlation\n\n## Chapter 8 - Crossover\n\nNOT ON THE FORMULA SHEET!!!!!\n\nCrossover trials offer more efficiency over parrallel due to within patient comparisons.\n\nTwo groups recieve two treatments but at different periods.\n\nPossible obsevred effects include:\n\n- Treatment effects, what we are trying to find, a difference in treatments\n- Period effect, different responses between periods could be due to seasonal effects or all patients improving over time\n- Carryover (also know as treatement x period interaction)\n\nTODO - 8.2\n\nGroups | Period 1 | Period 2\n-------|-----------|----------\nGroup 1 | A  ,  $Y_{11k}$ | B  ,  $Y_{12k}$\nGroup 2 | B  ,  $Y_{21k}$ | A  ,  $Y_{22k}$\n\nWe model the following:\n\n- $\\mu$ - overall mean\n- $\\tau_A , \\tau_B$ - Treatment effects\n- $\\pi_1, \\pi_2$ - Period effects\n- $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ - carryover effects\n- $\\alpha_k$ random patient effect $\\sim N(0, \\phi^2)$ between patients\n- $epsilon_{ijk}$ independent random error\n\n$\\alpha$ and $\\epsilon$ disappear by taking expectations\n\nFrom this we can conclude that:\n\nGroups | Period 1 | Period 2\n-------|-----------|----------\nGroup 1 | $\\mu + \\tau_A + \\pi_1$ | $\\mu + \\tau_B + \\pi_2 + \\lambda_A$\nGroup 2 | $\\mu + \\tau_B + \\pi_1$ | $\\mu + \\tau_A + \\pi_2 + \\lambda_B$\n\n### Workflow\n\nThere is more detail in the notes\n\n#### Assess Carryover\n\nIdeally carryover effects would be none or equal, so under \n\n$H_0 : \\lambda_A = \\lambda_B$\n\nSo two sample t-test\n\n$T = (Y_{i1k} +Y_{i2k})/2$, the average across each patient\n\n$\\frac{\\bar{T_1} - \\bar{T_2}}\n{\\sqrt{\n    \\frac{S^2_{T_1}}{n_1} +\n    \\frac{S^2_{T_2}}{n_2}\n}} \\sim t_r$\n\nWhere \n\n$r = min(n_1, n_2)$\n\nSome info:\n\n- We don't test that $H_0 : \\lambda_A = \\lambda_B= 0$ as inseperable from period effects\n- It is low powered due to between patient comparison\n- If detected, results are contaminated, do not test for period and treatment, fallback to a parrallel study in period 1. Power however will be too low.\n- It is fine to use the sum of the two values for each patient over the average, the t test will be the same, just don't have to divide by two.\n\n#### Assess Treatment\n\nAssumes no carryover\n\n$H_0 : \\tau_A = \\tau_B$ \n\nThen $D_{ik} = Y_{i1k} - Y_{i2k}$ calculated and as before\n\n$\\frac{\\bar{D_1} - \\bar{D_2}}\n{\\sqrt{\n    \\frac{S^2_{D_1}}{n_1} +\n    \\frac{S^2_{D_2}}{n_2}\n}} \\sim t_r$\n\n#### Assess Period\n\nAssumes no carryover\n\n$H_0 : \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$ \n\nThen $D_{ik} = Y_{i1k} - Y_{i2k}$ calculated and as before\n\n$\\frac{\\bar{D_1} - (-\\bar{D_2})}\n{\\sqrt{\n    \\frac{S^2_{D_1}}{n_1} +\n    \\frac{S^2_{D_2}}{n_2}\n}} \\sim t_r$\n\n#### Sample SIze\n\nSample size can be calulated as follows\n\nWhere n is the calculated number required for a parrallel arm and $\\rho$ is the correlation between two measurments on each patient. So clearly less patient.\n\n$N = n(1-\\rho)$\n\nTODO 8.6 onwards\n\n## Chapter 9 - Combining trials\n\nTODO\n\n## Chapter 10 - Comparing measurement methods\n\nWe may want to change measurment equipment due to cost, speed, patient comfort, etc.\n\nTests are not always appropriate as highly correlated and not independent. \n\nMore interested in Bias (continuous) and agreement (discrete).\n\nNeither provide a statistical test, it is based on judgement.\n\n### Bland Altman\n\n1) Calculate for each two measurements the difference and the mean\n2) Calulate the mean difference and the std\n3) Report a bias by mean difference with a CI ($\\bar{X} \\pm t_{0.975, \\nu} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}$)\n4) Create difference bands mean +/- 2sigma \n5) Plot scattter of x axis = avg, y axis = difference\n6) Add 95% CI from 4 to the y axis as horizontal lines.\n\nYou are really interested in whether there is a difference from left to right.\n\n### Kappa\n\nAgreement between\n\n$\\kappa =\\frac{A_{\\text{obs} -  A_{\\text{exp}}}}{1 - A_{\\text{exp}}}$\n\nkappa | statement\n-------|---------\n$\\kappa >0.75$ | Excellent Agreement\n$0.4<\\kappa <0.75$ | Fair to good agreement\n$\\kappa <0.4$ | poor to moderate\n\nCalculate by:\n\n1) Do row and column totals, as well as overall total\n2) $A_{obs} = \\frac{\\text{sum of diagonal}}{\\text{Overall Total}}$ \n3) Calc diagonal expected $\\frac{\\text{row total}\\times \\text{col total}}{\\text{Overall Total}}$\n4) $A_{exp}$ is the sum of diagonal expected divided by overall total\n\nOnly care about leading diagonal as these are agreements\n\nIn some cases groups may have order, or there may be more than two assessors. Either way more advanced versions required.\n\n\n# Chapter 11 - Not Logistic\n\n## Observational studies\n\nThese are referred to as epidemiological studies\n\nRetrospective studies look at a control group who do not exhibit diesease and group who do. Comparing factors between groups.\n\nProspective studies follow up on a cohort of people who have had some exposure. Eg those with premature birth. They are then compared to the general population for some outcome. Eg. Very poor school grades. \n\nFor prospective, typically very large samples are used due to rare incidence typically of the disease. $\\chi^2$ tests therefore are very powerful and flag very minor changes, without giving magnitude.\n\nTypically therefore work with Odds Ratios or Relative Risks and their respective CIs.\n\n### Prospective - Relative Risk\n\nCreate following table\n\nWhere positive means, tests positive, not an good positive\n\nExposure    |Positive outcome|Negative outcome|Total\n-------------|--|---|---------\nexposed     | a | b | a + b\nnot exposed | c | d | c + d\n\nThen calc:\n\n$RR = \\frac{a(c+d)}{c(a+b)}$\n\nIf there was no difference RR would equal 1.

So treatment \"turns on\" $beta_1$\n\nPositive $\\beta_1$ the odds of success are greater with treatment, negative means odds of success are greater in placebo.\n\n## Odds ratio\n\nSometimes Odds ratio is reffered to as relative risk as they are equivalent at small probabilities.\n\nOdds ratio of treatement can be calculated as \n\n$OR = \\exp(\\beta_1)$\n\nThis is derived from\n\n$\\frac{P(Y=1|x_1 = 1)}{P(Y=0|x_1 = 1)}/\n\\frac{P(Y=1|x_1 = 0)}{P(Y=0|x_1 = 0)} = OR$\n\n\n$OR = \\exp(\\beta_1)$ CAn also be used for other binary covariates, or two specicified continuous locations.\n\n## Partial Z Test\n\n$H_0 : \\beta_j = 0$\n\nWhere:\n\n$\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j}}{\n    \\sqrt{\n        \\hat{\\text{var}}(\\hat{\\beta_j)}\n    }\n} \\sim Z$\n\nThis is the SE $\\sqrt{\\hat{\\text{var}}(\\hat{\\beta_j)}}$\n\nIt is useful to know the following as SE may not be given\n\n$SE = \\frac{\\beta_j}{Z_j}\n\n## In exam\n\n1) Given R output\n2) Calulcate Z, SE, p-value for all of interest if not already given\n3) State the direction of the coeeficent and the impact therefore on probability.\n3) calulate the odds ratio by $\\exp(\\beta)$\n4) Report % increase/decrease in odds.\n6) Use SE to caluclate 95% CI for %\\beta$ and exponent to get CI for the OR, report as percentage increase/decrease"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"Clinical Trials.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.3.47","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"pdf"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"Clinical Trials.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}

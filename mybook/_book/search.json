    "text": "4.1 Chapter 1 - Intro\nWe are interested in two types of cencoring\n\nright : The failure occurs after a set time, died after trial\nleft : The failure occurs before the observations begin, died before trial starts\n\nThe fundamental probaility theory required is as follows\n\n4.1.1 Distribution Function\nLet \\(T\\) be the failure time, where \\(T>0\\). Then as expected the distribution function is:\n\\(F(t) = P(T\\leq t)\\)\nAnd therefore the probability density is:\n\\(f(t) = F'(t)\\)\nAnd so\n\\(F(t) = \\int_0^tf(u)du\\)\n\n\n4.1.2 Survivor Function\nGenerally we are interested in whether someone will survive longer than a certain time. So:\n\\(S(t) = P(T\\geq t) = 1 - F(t) = \\int^{\\infty}_t f(u) du\\)\nAs it is linked to the distribution function we can therefore say\n\\(f(t) = -S'(t)\\)\n\n\n4.1.3 Hazard Function\nThe risk of death at time \\(t\\) given survival to time \\(t\\). Or the instantaenous risk of death at time \\(t\\)\n\\(h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\)\n\n\n4.1.4 Integrated Hazard Function\n\\(H(t) = \\int^{t}_0 h(u) du = -log(S(t))\\)\nSo\n\\(S(t) = e^{\\left(-H(t)\\right)}\\)\nand\n\\(f(t) = h(t)e^{\\left(-H(t)\\right)}\\)\n\n\n4.1.5 Limits worth knowing\n\\(f(t) = lim_{h \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{P(t < T < t+h)}{h}\\)\nand\n\\(h(t) = lim_{h \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{P(t \\leq T < t+h | T \\geq t)}{h}\\)"
